The design requirements for the Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) are:

Gain (S21) > 15 dB at 2.4 GHz

Noise Figure (NF) < 2 dB

Input matching (S11) and output matching (S22) should be < -10 dB

Power consumption: < 5mW



We achieved:

S21: 15.47 dB at 2.4 GHz (exceeding the requirement)

S11: -14.65 dB (exceeding the requirement)    

S22: -15.86 dB (exceeding the requirement)

S12: -39 dB (exceeding the requirement)

NF: 1.6 dB (exceeding the requirement)

power consumption 1.2mW (exceeding the requirement)
