The design requirements for the Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) are:

Gain (S21) > 15 dB at 2.4 GHz
Noise Figure (NF) < 2 dB
Input matching (S11) and output matching (S22) should be < -10 dB
Power consumption: < 5mW
We achieved:

S21: 15.47 dB at 2.4 GHz (exceeding the requirement)
S11: -14.65 dB (meeting the requirement)
S22: -15.86 dB (not meeting the requirement)
S12: -39 dB
NF: 1.6 dB
power consumption 1.2mW
